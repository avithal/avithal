🔬 About Me

I’m a computer vision engineer with 10+ years of experience building classical and deep-learning–based vision systems, primarily in biotech and medical imaging.

I enjoy working on problems that require algorithmic depth, careful validation, and strong collaboration between research and engineering.

What I focus on:

Classical CV combined with modern deep learning to make robust systems
Research-to-production workflows
Medical image segmentation & registration
MRI / CT / microscopy pipeline
Work–life balance and long-term impact matter to me.
Clean, reproducible experiments
